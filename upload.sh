# Auto Git Sync Script, production edition (strict: exits on ANY error)
# Continuously watches a Git repository and does the following:
# 1. Compresses each new or modified PDF (smallest first) as soon as it is found, then stages it.
# 2. Uses the Git index (staging area) as the "already compressed" marker.
# 3. Pushes when 100 compressed files (or about 1.5 GB) are staged, or when the maximum wait time has passed.
# 4. Commits BEFORE pulling, so the batch is a real commit rather than fragile staged state.
# 5. Never stages a PDF that was not compressed by this script.
# 6. Exits immediately if any command fails (run it under systemd with Restart=on-failure).
# 7. Shows EVERYTHING on screen and writes it to a log file: this script, git, Ghostscript (page by page,
#    labelled with the PDF being compressed) and, optionally, the logs of other apps such as the downloader.
# 8. Ignores the downloader's half-finished '*.part' files, so they can never be committed.
# 9. Protects production: timeouts on every external command, a free-disk check, a startup remote check,
#    built-in log rotation, a periodic heartbeat, running statistics, and a final summary on exit.
# Tunables can be overridden from the environment, e.g.: LOG_LEVEL_NUMBER=0 bash upload.sh
# To merge the downloader's log into this one: EXTRA_LOG_FILES=/var/log/etsi-downloader.log bash upload.sh
